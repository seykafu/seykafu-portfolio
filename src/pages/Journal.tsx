I have a strong vision for myself in the next few years, but it's time to fall back down to Earth and begin with working on hands-on skills instead of always being in the clouds!\n\nSo for my professional life, I want to ensure that I'm developing hands-on skills as much as I am putting in effort to experiment and discover what I like and dislike. I really want to land an amazing full-time job somewhere in the realm of product management! What I do in the first half of 2021 will truly dictate my job search results.\n\nFor my personal life, it's about improving self care, my mental state, constantly learning and taking in new information & knowledge, and finally, growing with my relationship. Hopefully I'll still be in this relationship by the time I read this at the end of 2021 ðŸ™‚."
